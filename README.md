## What is debouncing?

In programming, "debouncing" refers to a technique used to prevent multiple triggering of an event or action due to rapid or repeated signals.
Specifically, it is a process of filtering out unwanted, extraneous signals or noise from an input signal that can result in multiple events being triggered when only one is desired.

## Problems to solve

* Prevent multiple clicks on a button from triggering the same action multiple times.
* Delay the processing of text field input until the user has finished typing, to improve performance and prevent unwanted intermediate results, like in search queries.
* Filter out noise and ensure that only valid sensor readings are used in decision-making processes.

## Reasons to use

* Convenient to use.
* Small source code size.
* 100% documented.
* Covered in unit tests.

## Installation

Using [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html):
```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.mmolosay:debounce:VERSION")
}
```
You can find the most recent version at the top of this file in __Maven__ badge.

## What to use
The centerpieces of this library are two functions:
 - [`debounced()`](/debounce/src/main/kotlin/io/github/mmolosay/debounce/Debounced.kt)
 - [`DebounceStateIdentity.debounce()`](/debounce/src/main/kotlin/io/github/mmolosay/debounce/Debounce.kt)

The main difference between them is the moment when debouncing timeout starts.

For `debounced()` timeout starts right after an execution of the action.
It suits for cases without any lasting async work. 

For `DebounceStateIdentity.debounce()` it is you who decide when to start a release timeout.
It's a right choice for actions which perform lasting async work.

> [!NOTE]
> Q: Does your action contain lasting async work?
> 
> A: NO â†’ [`debounced()`](/debounce/src/main/kotlin/io/github/mmolosay/debounce/Debounced.kt)
> 
> A: YES â†’ [`DebounceStateIdentity.debounce()`](/debounce/src/main/kotlin/io/github/mmolosay/debounce/Debounce.kt)

For examples of use see [Examples](#examples) section down below.
